# Students Capital
[Task #8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1agfSo-UU_ONLyN5OUOQl_wIqhULtC5w9_fxyUCT9tNQ/edit?usp=sharing) in Distributed Lab Challenge

This command-line interface (CLI) application helps a student maximize their capital during the summer by buying, fixing, and selling laptops. The program is designed to select the most profitable combination of laptops within the given constraints to increase the student's capital.

## How to Run the Code

To run this console app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Go code:

```
cd students-capital
```

3. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

4. Execute the Go code by running the following command:

```
go run main.go
```

5.Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the required parameters.

6.Once the program finishes executing, it will display the capital at the end of the summer based on the selected laptops and their gains.

## Input Parameters:
  - Limit on the number of laptops purchased(n).
  - Initial capital.
  - Laptops count(k).
  - Array of gains for each laptop.
  - Array of prices for each laptop.

## Algorithm
The application utilizes a modified binary search tree data structure to efficiently select the most profitable combination of laptops to buy.
  - Building the Tree: The program builds a binary search tree for laptops which sorted buy prices.O(klog(k))
  - Buying Laptops: The program goes through the tree looking for subtrees that can be bought with current capital and selects the most valuable node from them. The gain of a purchased node becomes zero.O(nlog(k))
  - Maximize capital: Buy most valuable laptop as long as the quantity does not exceed the maximum.
Total complexity: O(klog(k) + nlog(k))
There is another method:
  - Sort aptops buy prices.O(klog(k))
  - Use the heap to store the most valuable laptops.
  - While passing through the array add to heap new laptop if capital allows otherwise buy laptops from the heap. O(klog(k))
Total complexity: O(klog(k) + klog(k))

Theoretically my algorithm has less complexity

## Conclusion
The Studentâ€™s Capital CLI application provides a robust solution for maximizing a student's capital during the summer by efficiently buying, fixing, and selling laptops. By leveraging a modified binary search tree algorithm, the program optimally selects the most profitable combination of laptops while adhering to the constraints of the student's capital and the number of laptops to buy.
